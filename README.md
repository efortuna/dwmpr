Instructions for running: 

- Make sure your computer is set up to run [Flutter code](https://flutter.io/) 
- Check out repository
- Create a token.dart file in lib/full_version/github/. This file needs to contain a variable defining your [github access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/). The file should look something like this:

        final token = 'my personal Github token here';
